✨ What's New in Version 2.1

This update brings advanced workflow tools for handling complex character states and improved usability.

📂 Multi-Sheet Support: Upload separate sprite sheets for specific states (IDLE, WALK, JUMP, CROUCH).
⏱️ Per-State Timings: Set individual frame lookups for each state (e.g., 4 frames for Idle, 6 for Walk) for perfect animation speeds.
🧘 Crouch Mechanic: Added a dedicated Crouch state (trigger with 'S' or Down Arrow) with its own sheet and row logic.
🖐️ Logic Map Drag-and-Drop: Drag files directly onto the "Idle Sheet" or "Walk Sheet" buttons to instantly load them.
🎨 Alignment & UI: Improved grid alignment and "Frames" labels for better readability.

Core Features

🎨 Sprite Management & Calibration

Moodsprite allows for granular control over how your sprite sheet is interpreted.
Dynamic Slicing: Adjust frame width and height in real-time to find the perfect fit for your grid.
Offset Controls: Fine-tune the X and Y offsets to center your character within its hitbox perfectly.
Background Selector: Switch between procedural backgrounds (Grass, Space, Stone) or upload your own custom environment image.

⚙️ Physics & Simulation

Don't just look at your sprite—play it.

WASD / Arrow Keys: Move your character around the canvas.
Gravity Slider: Adjust the physics gravity to test different weight settings (0.1 to 2.0).
Debug Mode: Toggle hitboxes and state visualization (IDLE, WALK, JUMP, POS) to debug interactions.

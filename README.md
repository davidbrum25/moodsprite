✨ What's New in Version 2.0

This major update transforms Moodsprite into a fully functional testing ground for 2D assets.

🕹️ Live Physics Playground: Test your sprites in a reactive environment. Walk, jump, and idle to see how your animations feel in actual gameplay.
🪄 Magic Wand Removal: Instantly remove solid backgrounds from uploaded sprite sheets with the new client-side processing tool.
🧠 Logic Mapping: Define specific sprite sheet rows for IDLE, WALK, and JUMP states to automate animation switching.
💾 Config Export: Once you've calibrated your sprite's size, offsets, and speed, export a .json file to use directly in your game engine.
🌑 Brand New UI: A sleek, dark-mode interface with glassmorphism effects, improved sliders, and a cohesive footer.

Core Features

🎨 Sprite Management & Calibration

Moodsprite allows for granular control over how your sprite sheet is interpreted.
Dynamic Slicing: Adjust frame width and height in real-time to find the perfect fit for your grid.
Offset Controls: Fine-tune the X and Y offsets to center your character within its hitbox perfectly.
Background Selector: Switch between procedural backgrounds (Grass, Space, Stone) or upload your own custom environment image.

⚙️ Physics & Simulation

Don't just look at your sprite—play it.

WASD / Arrow Keys: Move your character around the canvas.
Gravity Slider: Adjust the physics gravity to test different weight settings (0.1 to 2.0).
Debug Mode: Toggle hitboxes and state visualization (IDLE, WALK, JUMP, POS) to debug interactions.
